      Like traffic signals, color-coding messages can quickly communicate intent
      and help separate them from the flow of other messages in the timeline.

        An optional value that can either be one of good, warning, danger, or any hex color code (eg. #439FE0). This value is used to color the border along the left side of the message attachment.
  footer:
    type: string
    example: footer
    description: >
      Add some brief text to help contextualize and identify an attachment.
      Limited to 300 characters, and may be truncated further when displayed to
      users in environments with limited screen real estate
  footer_icon:
    type: string
    example: footer icon
    description: >
      To render a small icon beside your footer text, provide a publicly
      accessible URL string in the footer_icon field. You must also provide a
      footer for the field to be recognized.


      We'll render what you provide at 16px by 16px. It's best to use an image
      that is similarly sized.
  image url:
    type: string
    example: url
    description: >
      A valid URL to an image file that will be displayed inside a message
      attachment. We currently support the following formats: GIF, JPEG, PNG,
      and BMP.


      Large images will be resized to a maximum width of 360px or a maximum
      height of 500px, while still maintaining the original aspect ratio.
  pretext:
    type: string
    example: pretext
    description: |
      This is optional text that appears above the message attachment block.
  status:
    default: 0
    type: integer
  text:
    type: string
    example: text
    description: >
      This is the main text in a message attachment, and can contain standard
      message markup. The content will automatically collapse if it contains
      700+ characters or 5+ linebreaks, and will display a "Show more..." link
      to expand the content. Links posted in the text field will not unfurl
  thumb_url:
    type: string
    example: url
    description: >
      A valid URL to an image file that will be displayed as a thumbnail on the
      right side of a message attachment. We currently support the following
      formats: GIF, JPEG, PNG, and BMP.

        The thumbnail's longest dimension will be scaled down to 75px while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image. The filesize of the image must also be less than 500 KB.
        
        For best results, please use images that are already 75px by 75px.
  title:
    type: string
    example: title
    description: >
      The title is displayed as larger, bold text near the top of a message
      attachment. By passing a valid URL in the title_link parameter (optional),
      the title text will be hyperlinked.
  title_link:
    type: string
    example: url
    description: >
      The title is displayed as larger, bold text near the top of a message
      attachment. By passing a valid URL in the title_link parameter (optional),
      the title text will be hyperlinked.
  ts:
    default: 0
    type: integer
    description: >
      Does your attachment relate to something happening at a specific time?


      By providing the ts field with an integer value in "epoch time", the
      attachment will display an additional timestamp value as part of the
      attachment's footer.


      Use ts when referencing articles or happenings. Your message's timestamp
      will be displayed in varying ways, depending on how far in the past or
      future it is, relative to the present. Form factors, like mobile versus
      desktop may also transform its rendered appearance.


      Example: Providing 123456789 would result in a rendered timestamp of Nov
      29th, 1973. If it were currently 1973, the year might be trimmed off. If
      it were only a few days ago, we might display also display the time of
      day, like 9:33pm.
  buttons:
    allOf:
      - $ref: '#/definitions/Button'
  fields:
    description: >
      Fields are defined as an array. Each entry in the array is a single field.
      Each field is defined as a dictionary with key-value pairs. Fields get
      displayed in a table-like way. See the below example.

        For best results, include no more than 2-3 key/value pairs. There is no optimal, programmatic way to display a greater amount of tabular data.
